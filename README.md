# Multibound
An Earthbound ROM hack that aims to give the game multiplayer functionality.

### What this hack adds
This hack is in it's very early stages. Currently, there is only a second player present in the starting room, and he has no wall collision.

### How to set up:
1. Legally acquire the ROM for Earthbound.
2. Download a SNES Emulator (I use this →[Mesen Emulator](https://www.mesen.ca/))
3. Grab the patch file.
4. Apply the patch (I use this website: https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/ )
5. Open the patched ROM using the emulator.

Make sure that you have a second controller keybinded. Player 2 moves with the D pad, and teleports with select.

NOTE: You’ll have to go through the procedure of starting a new game and configuring some stuff before you can see the hack.
