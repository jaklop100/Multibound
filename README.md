# Multibound
An Earthbound ROM hack that aims to give the game multiplayer functionality.

### What this hack adds
This hack is in it's very early stages. Currently, there is only a second player present in the starting room, and it has no wall collision, or ability to interact. The only things you can do right now are move the second player around in 8 directions, and teleport it back to player 1's positon.

### HOW TO SET UP:
1. Legally acquire the ROM for Earthbound. (Make sure it's a .sfc file.)
2. Download a SNES Emulator (I use this →[Mesen Emulator](https://www.mesen.ca/))
3. Grab the patch file (multibound.bps) in this folder.
4. Apply the patch to the original ROM to create a new patched ROM. (I use [this website](https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/))
5. Open the patched ROM using the emulator.
   
### CONTROLS
NOTE: These controls are from the original SNES controllers. They may or may not already be keybinded to your keyboard by your emulator. You will have to check and make sure all of the following controls are keybinded. 

**Menu interaction:** On the player 1 controller, press **A** to confirm and **B** to go back.

**Movement:** Use the **[joypad](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j5BWA0cck0ML5uW4BYEAG07ymAa-6SmY/view?usp=sharing)** on the player 1 controller to move player 1, and the same on the player 2 controller to move player 2.

**Teleporting:** Press **select** on the player 2 controller to teleport player 2 to player 1's position.

NOTE: You’ll have to go through the procedure of starting a new game and configuring some stuff before you can see the hack.
